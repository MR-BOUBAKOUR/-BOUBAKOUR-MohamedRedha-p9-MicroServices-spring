MediLabo Solutions - Diabetes Risk Assessment

Microservices application for diabetes risk assessment built with Spring Boot and Vue.js.

---

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Service discovery**: Eureka Server
- **API Gateway**: Spring Cloud Gateway - *(routing, auth)*
- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Patient**: business microservice - MySQL
- **Notes**: business microservice - MongoDB
- **Assessments**: business microservice - *(aggregation, logic, results)*

---

### 🧰 Technology stack

- **Backend**: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.4.1, Spring Security, Spring Cloud Gateway, Eureka
- **Frontend**: Vue.js 3, Pinia (Store Manager), Axios
- **Databases**: MySQL 8, MongoDB
- **Communication**: RestAPI, OpenFeign, ⚠️ *Kafka or RabbitMQ (on the roadmap)*
- **Observability**: ⚠️ *ELK Stack, OpenTelemetry / Prometheus / Grafana (on the roadmap)*
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker-Compose, ⚠️ *Kubernetes (on the roadmap)*

---

### ❌ Out of scope

- **Spring Cloud Config Server**: No centralized configuration management. *(used in a different project, with RabbitMQ as the refresh trigger and a GitHub repository for versioning and storing configurations)*
- **Secrets Manager**: Secrets are managed via environment variables.

### 🔧 In progress

#### Security implementation versions
- JWT header only (`branch: jwt-header`) ✅ current
- Access token in header + Refresh token in HttpOnly cookie (`branch: access-header-refresh-httponly`)
- HTTP-only cookies full implementation (`branch: all-httponly`)
- OAuth2 login via Spring Security (`branch: oauth2`)
- Keycloak integration (`branch: keycloak`)

#### Resilience
- Resilience4J - circuit breakers and retry patterns
