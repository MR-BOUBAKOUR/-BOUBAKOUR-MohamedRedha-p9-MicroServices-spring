### üîî Event-Driven

The system implements asynchronous communication using **RabbitMQ** for critical notifications:

- **High-Risk Assessment Events**: when a patient is assessed as `"Early onset"`, the **Assessments** service publishes an event to the `high-risk-assessments` queue
- **No duplicates**: the alert is triggered only when the risk changes to `"Early onset"`
- **Email Notifications**: the **Notifications** service consumes these events and sends automated email alerts to healthcare providers (emails are intercepted using **Mailtrap** during development)

---

### üß™ Testing Strategy

#### ‚úÖ Unit & Integration Tests

- Implemented for: **Patients**, **Notes**, **Assessments** and the **Gateway**
- Covers core business logic, database operations, and Feign communication

#### ‚úÖ End-to-End (E2E) Tests

The full journey test simulates a real doctor's workflow using `DoctorJourneyE2ETest`:
- Verifies patient creation, note insertion and risk assessment logic
- Covers a 4-step risk evolution: *None ‚Üí Borderline ‚Üí In Danger ‚Üí Early onset*
- Confirms high-risk email delivery by checking the notifications service logs
- Validates data flow across all services
- Uses **Awaitility** to ensure service readiness and propagation
- Executed in a real environment with **Docker Compose**

---

### üöÄ CI/CD Pipelines

- `push_dev_ci.yml`: runs unit tests on modified microservices when pushing to `dev`
- `pr_main_ci-cd.yml`: builds, tests, generates JaCoCo & JavaDocs, deploys docs to GitHub Pages (on PR to `main`)
- `merge_main_cd.yml`: pushes Docker images to Docker Hub after PR is merged into `main`

---

### ‚ùå Out of scope

- **Spring Cloud Config Server**: no centralized configuration management. *(used in a different project, with RabbitMQ as the refresh trigger and a GitHub repository for versioning and storing configurations)*
- **Secrets Manager**: secrets are managed via environment variables.
- **Front-end testing** : deprioritized to focus efforts on back-end reliability and service integration.
