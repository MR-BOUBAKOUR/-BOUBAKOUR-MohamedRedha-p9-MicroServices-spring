``MediLabo Solutions - Diabetes risk assessment

Microservices application for diabetes risk assessment built with Spring Boot and Vue.js.

üîç [Performance analysis](_doc/performance-analysis.md) ‚Äî the main performance bottleneck was the system resource contention caused by running the app, monitoring, and load tests on the same machine ‚Äî not the application itself.

üìÑ [Documentation & Reports](https://mr-boubakour.github.io/-BOUBAKOUR-MohamedRedha-p9-MicroServices-spring/) ‚Äî includes **Javadoc** and **JaCoCo reports** for the microservices where documentation and test coverage bring the most value.

### üìä Observability & monitoring

The system includes comprehensive observability to ensure reliability and simplify production diagnostics.

- **Logs**: collected via Alloy, centralized and indexed in Loki
- **Metrics**: exposed by Micrometer, scraped by Prometheus
- **Distributed Traces**: captured by OpenTelemetry, stored in Tempo

All data is visualized and analyzed through Grafana.

The custom dashboard is based on the two popular dashboards : **JVM (Micrometer) & Spring Boot Observability**.

![Custom Observability Dashboard](_img/dashboard-image.png)

It highlights critical KPIs to ensure system health and performance:

- **Uptime** ‚Äî indicates system availability and stability over time
- **CPU usage (system and process)** ‚Äî monitors resource consumption and detects overloads
- **Memory usage (heap and non-heap)** ‚Äî tracks JVM memory usage to identify leaks or pressure
- **Request rate (requests per second)** ‚Äî measures traffic volume handled by the service
- **Request duration (99th percentile, 95th percentile, 50th percentile)** ‚Äî captures latency distributions for real user experience insights
- **Total requests and status codes (2xx, 5xx)** ‚Äî tracks success and error rates to monitor reliability
- **Exception counts** ‚Äî identifies unexpected failures not caught by HTTP status codes

### üß™ Testing strategy

#### ‚úÖ Unit & Integration tests

- Implemented for: **Patients**, **Notes**, **Assessments** and the **Gateway**
- Covers core business logic, database operations, and Feign communication

#### ‚úÖ End-to-End (E2E) tests

The full journey test simulates a real doctor's workflow using `DoctorJourneyE2ETest`:
- Verifies patient creation, note insertion and risk assessment logic
- Covers a 4-step risk evolution: *None ‚Üí Borderline ‚Üí In Danger ‚Üí Early onset*
- Confirms high-risk email delivery by checking the notifications service logs
- Validates data flow across all services
- Uses **Awaitility** to ensure service readiness and propagation
- Executed in a real environment with **Docker Compose**

#### ‚úÖ Performance tests (load)
- A full analysis was conducted to understand the system's saturation behavior.  
  üëâ [Read the full performance analysis](_doc/performance-analysis.md)

---

### üîî Event-driven

The system implements asynchronous communication using **RabbitMQ** for critical notifications:

- **High-Risk assessment events**: when a patient is assessed as `"Early onset"`, the **Assessments** service publishes an event to the `high-risk-assessments` queue
- **No duplicates**: the alert is triggered only when the risk changes to `"Early onset"`
- **Email notifications**: the **Notifications** service consumes these events and sends automated email alerts to healthcare providers (emails are intercepted using **Mailtrap** during development)


---

### üöÄ CI/CD pipelines

- `push_dev_ci.yml`: runs unit tests on modified microservices when pushing to `dev`
- `pr_main_ci-cd.yml`: builds, tests, generates JaCoCo & JavaDocs, deploys docs to GitHub Pages (on PR to `main`)
- `merge_main_cd.yml`: pushes Docker images to Docker Hub after PR is merged into `main`

---

### ‚ùå Out of scope

- **Spring Cloud Config Server**: no centralized configuration management. *(used in a different project, with RabbitMQ as the refresh trigger and a GitHub repository for versioning and storing configurations)*
- **Secrets manager**: secrets are managed via environment variables.
- **Front-end testing** : deprioritized to focus efforts on back-end reliability and service integration.
